# Chirpy

This is a simple app to learn how to web servers in go programming language. The name of the demo application built is Chripy.
Chirpy is a social network similar to twitter. (just a very small one for learning purpose)

## What I Learned While Building Chirpy

Building Chirpy, though small in scope, provided valuable insights into various aspects of server-side programming in Go. Here's a summary of the key concepts and skills I developed:

- **Server Fundamentals**: Understanding how to set up and manage a basic web server in Go.
- **Routing**: Implementing routing to handle different endpoints and HTTP methods.
- **Server Architectures**: Exploring different server architectures to build scalable and maintainable applications.
- **JSON Handling**: Parsing and generating JSON data for communication between the server and clients.
- Storage Solutions: Learning how to manage data persistence, including storing user information and posts.
- **Authentication**: Implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication, including workflows with access and refresh tokens.
- **Authorization**: Controlling access to resources based on user permissions.
- **Webhooks**: Setting up webhooks to enable real-time notifications and integrations.
- **Documentation**: Writing clear and concise documentation to explain the purpose and document API.
